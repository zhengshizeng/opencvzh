    "origin": "Many traditional white balance algorithms are statistics-based, i.e. they rely on the fact that certain assumptions should hold in properly white-balanced images like the well-known grey-world assumption. However, better results can often be achieved by leveraging large datasets of images with ground-truth illuminants in a learning-based framework. This tutorial demonstrates how to train a learning-based white balance algorithm and evaluate the quality of the results.",
