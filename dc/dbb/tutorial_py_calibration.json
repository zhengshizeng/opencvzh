The important input data needed for calibration of the camera is the set of 3D real world points and the corresponding 2D coordinates of these points in the image. 2D image points are OK which we can easily find from the image.

This consideration helps us to find only X,Y values. Now for X,Y values, we can simply pass the points as (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), ... which denotes the location of points. In this case, the results we get will be in the scale of size of chess board square. But if we know the square size, (say 30 mm), we can pass the values as (0,0), (30,0), (60,0), ... .
