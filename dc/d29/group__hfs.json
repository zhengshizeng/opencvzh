After obtaining weight for each edge, it will exploit EGB (Efficient Graph-based Image Segmentation) algorithm to merge some nodes in the graph thus obtaining a coarser segmentation After these operations, a post process will be executed to merge regions that are smaller then a specific number of pixels into their nearby region.",
