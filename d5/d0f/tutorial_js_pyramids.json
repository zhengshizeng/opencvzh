In that case, we will need to create a set of the same image with different resolutions and search for object in all of them. These set of images with different resolutions are called",

So area reduces to one-fourth of original area. It is called an Octave. The same pattern continues as we go upper in pyramid (ie, resolution decreases). Similarly while expanding, area becomes 4 times in each level. We can find Gaussian pyramids using",
