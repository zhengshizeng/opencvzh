In this case the tracked 2d points will have the following structure, a vector of 2d points array, where each inner array represents a different frame. Every frame is composed by a list of 2d points which e.g. the first point in frame 1 is the same point in frame 2. If there is no point in a frame the assigned value will be (-1,-1):",
