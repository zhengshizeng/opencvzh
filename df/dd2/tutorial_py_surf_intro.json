    "origin": "In last chapter, we saw SIFT for keypoint detection and description. But it was comparatively slow and people needed more speeded-up version. In 2006, three people, Bay, H., Tuytelaars, T. and Van Gool, L, published another paper, \"SURF: Speeded Up Robust Features\" which introduced a new algorithm called SURF. As name suggests, it is a speeded-up version of SIFT.",

  {
    "origin": "In SIFT, Lowe approximated Laplacian of Gaussian with Difference of Gaussian for finding scale-space. SURF goes a little further and approximates LoG with Box Filter. Below image shows a demonstration of such an approximation. One big advantage of this approximation is that, convolution with box filter can be easily calculated with the help of integral images. And it can be done in parallel for different scales. Also the SURF rely on determinant of Hessian matrix for both scale and location.",

    "origin": "For orientation assignment, SURF uses wavelet responses in horizontal and vertical direction for a neighbourhood of size 6s. Adequate gaussian weights are also applied to it. Then they are plotted in a space as given in below image. The dominant orientation is estimated by calculating the sum of all responses within a sliding orientation window of angle 60 degrees. Interesting thing is that, wavelet response can be found out using integral images very easily at any scale. For many applications, rotation invariance is not required, so no need of finding this orientation, which speeds up the process. SURF provides such a functionality called Upright-SURF or U-SURF. It improves speed and is robust upto \\(\\pm 15^{\\circ}\\). OpenCV supports both, depending upon the flag,",

    "origin": "For feature description, SURF uses Wavelet responses in horizontal and vertical direction (again, use of integral images makes things easier). A neighbourhood of size 20sX20s is taken around the keypoint where s is the size. It is divided into 4x4 subregions. For each subregion, horizontal and vertical wavelet responses are taken and a vector is formed like this, \\(v=( \\sum{d_x}, \\sum{d_y}, \\sum{|d_x|}, \\sum{|d_y|})\\). This when represented as a vector gives SURF feature descriptor with total 64 dimensions. Lower the dimension, higher the speed of computation and matching, but provide better distinctiveness of features.",

    "origin": "For more distinctiveness, SURF feature descriptor has an extended 128 dimension version. The sums of \\(d_x\\) and \\(|d_x|\\) are computed separately for \\(d_y &lt; 0\\) and \\(d_y \\geq 0\\). Similarly, the sums of \\(d_y\\) and \\(|d_y|\\) are split up according to the sign of \\(d_x\\) , thereby doubling the number of features. It doesn't add much computation complexity.

    "origin": "Another important improvement is the use of sign of Laplacian (trace of Hessian Matrix) for underlying interest point. It adds no computation cost since it is already computed during detection. The sign of the Laplacian distinguishes bright blobs on dark backgrounds from the reverse situation. In the matching stage, we only compare features if they have the same type of contrast (as shown in image below). This minimal information allows for faster matching, without reducing the descriptor's performance.",
