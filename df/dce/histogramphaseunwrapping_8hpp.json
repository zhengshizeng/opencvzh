    "origin": "This algorithm belongs to the quality-guided phase unwrapping methods. First, it computes a reliability map from second differences between a pixel and its eight neighbours. Reliability values lie between 0 and 16*pi*pi. Then, this reliability map is used to compute the reliabilities of \"edges\". An edge is an entity defined by two pixels that are connected horizontally or vertically. Its reliability is found by adding the the reliabilities of the two pixels connected through it. Edges are sorted in a histogram based on their reliability values. This histogram is then used to unwrap pixels, starting from the highest quality pixel.",
