    "origin": "Background subtraction is a major preprocessing steps in many vision based applications. For example, consider the cases like visitor counter where a static camera takes the number of visitors entering or leaving the room, or a traffic camera extracting information about the vehicles etc. In all these cases, first you need to extract the person or vehicles alone. Technically, you need to extract the moving foreground from static background.",

  {
    "origin": "If you have an image of background alone, like image of the room without visitors, image of the road without vehicles etc, it is an easy job. Just subtract the new image from the background. You get the foreground objects alone. But in most of the cases, you may not have such an image, so we need to extract the background from whatever images we have. It become more complicated when there is shadow of the vehicles. Since shadow is also moving, simple subtraction will mark that also as foreground. It complicates things.",

It is based on two papers by Z.Zivkovic, \"Improved adaptive Gaussian mixture model for background subtraction\" in 2004 and \"Efficient Adaptive Density Estimation per Image Pixel for the Task of Background Subtraction\" in 2006. One important feature of this algorithm is that it selects the appropriate number of gaussian distribution for each pixel. It provides better adaptibility to varying scenes due illumination changes etc.",
