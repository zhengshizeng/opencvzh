For every pixel in the image a program calculated a histogram (first plane of color space) of the neighbouring of size 2*size+1. and assigned the value of the most frequently occurring value. The result looks almost like an oil painting. Parameter 4 of oilPainting is used to decrease image dynamic and hence increase oil painting effect.",
