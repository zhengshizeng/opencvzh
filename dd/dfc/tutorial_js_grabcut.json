Then algorithm segments it iteratively to get the best result. Done. But in some cases, the segmentation won't be fine, like, it may have marked some foreground region as background and vice versa. In that case, user need to do fine touch-ups. Just give some strokes on the images where some faulty results are there. Strokes basically says *\"Hey, this region should be foreground, you marked it background, correct it in next iteration\"* or its opposite for background. Then in the next iteration, you get better results.",
