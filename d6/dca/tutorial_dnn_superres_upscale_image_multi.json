OpenCVs dnn module supports accessing multiple nodes in one inference, if the names of the nodes are given. Currently there is one model included that is capable of giving more output in one inference run, that is the LapSRN model. LapSRN supports multiple outputs with one forward pass. It can now support 2x, 4x, 8x, and (2x, 4x) and (2x, 4x, 8x) super-resolution. The uploaded trained model files have the following output node names:",
