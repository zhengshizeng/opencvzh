During the last session on camera calibration, you have found the camera matrix, distortion coefficients etc. Given a pattern image, we can utilize the above information to calculate its pose, or how the object is situated in space, like how it is rotated, how it is displaced etc. For a planar object, we can assume Z=0, such that, the problem now becomes how camera is placed in space to see our pattern image. So, if we know how the object lies in the space, we can draw some 2D diagrams in it to simulate the 3D effect. Let's see how to do it.",
